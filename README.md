# CPTS-460-Operating-Systems-and-Computer-Architecture
Taken Fall 2021 at WSU 
Labs and Final Project for CPTS 460. All code is done in C, bash scripting, and assembly. Meant to be run with qeumu on a Linux distro. The MTX OS is custom built by K.C. Wang. Intended goal of the class is to learn how operating systems work. The MTX interacts with an EXT2 filesystem

## Development Setup

- Ubuntu 32-bit
- qeumu-system-i386
- bcc
- as86
- ld86

## Final/Last:
- Final Project for the class which creates a primitive fully functional UNIX like OS using the MTX kernel provided by K.C. Wang. The project is intended to be run on a x86 processor from boot. Real mode (boot) only supports 16 bit instructions, thus a compiler that supports 16-bit output is required.
